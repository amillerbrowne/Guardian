  		<h1>About Guardian</h1>
  		<br>
  		<p>Not every runner who goes out for a run comes home safely or in one piece. And the truth is that they are never 100% safe from
people or from cars, regardless of the time of day, their age or even gender. Accidents happen. Last year, between the months
of July and November, there were at least five people who were killed while going on a run. Vanessa Marcotte, 27, was killed in
August 2016 during an afternoon jog half a mile from her mother’s home. She was found a couple hours later with her hands,
feet, and head burned. Fast forward to April 2017, the murderer is still out there. The police did, however, release a DNA profile of
the likely killer back in February, but the killer’s identity remains unknown. Karina Vetrano, 30, was strangled while going on 5pm
jog. She was found 15 feet from the running path. Fast forward to February, Chanel Lewis admitted to killing Karina because he
hated women; he raped and strangled her. The attack was deemed random and there was no conversation between the two. It is
incidents like these that are the problem and are what inspired our customer to conceptualize this project.</p>

<p><strong>Our goal is to alleviate this problem and save lives by developing a comfortable and concealable device, targeted towards both
male and female runners that will reassure them of their safety as they continue on their path to wellness and success. </strong> This
device is essential because although there are no statistics specifically tracking jogger deaths, they are happening - more than
enough. Alexandra Brueger died in July 2016. She was shot in the back four times and her murderer has not be caught. Her loved
ones did not take it well, especially her mom, who said “We have nothing now. We don’t have her, there won’t be a wedding, there
are no grandchildren ... it’s the worst thing that could ever happen to me. Nothing else really matters. I could die now and I’d be
with her”. People should not be dying like this nor should they have to feel this way. </p>

<p><strong>This device called Guardian, will be able to send text messages, make calls, and locate a runner
geographically, in order to send out notifications to their emergency contacts and/or 911. </strong>Our final deliverable will be a device that
is stored inside an armband for discreteness and easy access. The device will be triggered through button activation. Our system
is one PCB board that is compact and small with a waterproof encasement. In conjunction with this device, a web application will
be made for runners to allow their emergency contacts to get their coordinates in real-time and the mobile application will allow
users to edit the list of their emergency contacts and plan their running route of the day.</p>

<p>Guardian is different from all the products offered in the market right now because our device is more sophisticated; it has both
a web application and mobile application component to it. It is also discrete so that assailants will not be able to immediately
locate or identify the device if found. Additionally, even though our main focus is to target runners, Guardian can be used for other
activities such as walking or driving. Because of its size and portability, it can easily be taken out of the armband and placed into
a pocket.</p>
